# Tries

A Trie is a special form of a Nary tree. Typically, a trie is used to store strings. Each Trie node represents a string (a prefix). Each node might have several children nodes while the paths to different children nodes represent different characters. And the strings the child nodes represent will be the origin string represented by the node itself plus the character on the path

In the example, the value we mark in each node is the string the node represents. For instance, we start from the root node and choose the second path 'b', then choose the first child 'a', and choose child 'd', finally we arrived at the node "bad". The value of the node is exactly formed by the letters in the path from the root to the node sequentially.

It is worth noting that the root node is associated with the empty string.

One important property of Trie is that all the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node. That's why Trie is also called prefix tree.

Let's look at the example again. For example, the strings represented by nodes in the subtree rooted at node "b" have a common prefix "b". And vice versa. The strings which have the common prefix "b" are all in the subtree rooted at node "b" while the strings with different prefixes will come to different branches.

Trie is widely used in various applications, such as autocomplete, spell checker, etc. We will introduce the practical applications in later chapters.

## Inserting a trie

When we insert a target value into a BST, in each node, we need to decide which child node to go according to the relationship between the value of the node and the target value. Similarly, when we insert a target value into a Trie, we will also decide which path to go depending on the target value we insert.

To be more specific, if we insert a string S into Trie, we start with the root node. We will choose a child or add a new child node depending on S[0], the first character in S. Then we go down to the second node and we will make a choice according to S[1]. Then we go down to the third node, so on and so for. Finally, we traverse all characters in S sequentially and reach the end. The end node will be the node which represents the string S.

## Searching

As we mentioned in the introduction to Trie, all the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node. Therefore, it should be easy to search if there are any words in the trie that starts with the given prefix.

Similarly, we can go down the tree depending on the given prefix. Once we can not find the child node we want, search fails. Otherwise, search succeeds. 

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

Trie() Initializes the trie object.
void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

Constraints:

1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000
word and prefix consist only of lowercase English letters.
At most 3 * 104 calls in total will be made to insert, search, and startsWith.
