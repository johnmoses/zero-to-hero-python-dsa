# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is actually a separate object and all the objects are linked together by the reference field in each element. It is an alternative data structure to array-based sequences. 

It makes use of a lightweight object called node to allocate referrences to each element. It employs a couple of techniques to overcome some of the shortcomings of the sequence classes.
