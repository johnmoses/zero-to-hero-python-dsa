# Sorting

Sorting is the rearrangement of elements in a specified order or to produce a new copy of the sequence

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

## Selection Sort

The Selection Sort algorithm finds the lowest value in an array and moves it to the front of the array.

## Insertion Sort

The Insertion Sort algorithm uses one part of the array to hold the sorted values, and the other part of the array to hold values that are not sorted yet.

## Quick Sort

The Quicksort algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it

## Radix Sort

The Radix Sort algorithm sorts an array by individual digits, starting with the least significant digit (the rightmost one).

## Heap Sort

## Merge Sort

## Bucket Sort
